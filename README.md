# The ATTN Protocol

A decentralized framework enabling paid content promotion within the Nostr ecosystem. Standardized communication methods unlock new economic opportunities while preserving privacy, permissionless access, and user sovereignty.

It also functions as the Bitcoin-native attention interchange for block-synced marketplaces. Bitcoin node services broadcast each new block height (kind 38088), services react in lockstep, and marketplace state freezes so every snapshot stays truthful.
