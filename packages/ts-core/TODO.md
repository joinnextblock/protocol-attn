Tasks and improvements for the ATTN Core package, organized by priority.

## Milestone Reference

- **M1-M3**: Foundation (Complete)
- **M4-M7**: Economy (In Progress)
- **M8-M10**: City Life (Planned)

All tasks must include a milestone tag: `[M#]`

## 🔴 Critical (Address Immediately)

_No critical issues at this time. Add items as they are identified._

## ⚠️ High Priority (Address Soon)

_No high priority items at this time. Add items as they are identified._

## 📝 Medium Priority (Address When Possible)

- [ ] [M4] Consider adding unit tests for constants and types
  - File: `src/constants.ts`, `src/types.ts`
  - Issue: Core package is minimal but could benefit from tests to ensure constants are correct
  - Impact: Low risk but tests would provide confidence in constant values
  - Recommendation: Add minimal test suite to verify constant values match specification

## 💡 Low Priority (Nice to Have)

_No low priority items at this time. Add items as they are identified._
