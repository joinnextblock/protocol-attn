# ATTN-01 - ATTN Protocol - Core

`draft` `mandatory`

## Abstract

ATTN-01 defines the event kinds, schemas, and tag specifications for the ATTN Protocol.

## Event Kinds

### Protocol Event Kinds
- **38088**: BLOCK (Bitcoin block arrival)
- **38188**: MARKETPLACE
- **38288**: BILLBOARD
- **38388**: PROMOTION
- **38488**: ATTENTION
- **38588**: BILLBOARD_CONFIRMATION
- **38688**: VIEWER_CONFIRMATION
- **38788**: MARKETPLACE_CONFIRMATION
- **38888**: MATCH (promotion-attention match)

### Standard Event Kinds
- **30000**: NIP-51 Lists (blocked promotions, blocked promoters, trusted billboards, trusted marketplaces)

## Event Schemas

The ATTN Protocol uses only official Nostr tags. All custom data is stored in the JSON content field. Block height is stored as a `t` tag for filtering and is required on every event. Tags are used for indexing/filtering; actual data is in the content field.

**Tags used:** `d` (identifier), `t` (block height), `a` (event coordinates), `e` (event references), `p` (pubkeys), `r` (relays), `k` (kinds), `u` (URLs)

### BLOCK Event (kind 38088)

**Purpose:** Published by Bitcoin node services when a new Bitcoin block is confirmed. Used by marketplaces to synchronize auction rounds and finalize matches. This is the foundational event that establishes the timing primitive for the entire protocol.

**Content Fields:**
- `height` (number, required): Block height
- `hash` (string, required): Block hash
- `time` (number, required): Block timestamp (Unix time)
- `difficulty` (string, optional): Block difficulty
- `tx_count` (number, optional): Number of transactions
- `size` (number, optional): Block size in bytes
- `weight` (number, optional): Block weight
- `version` (number, optional): Block version
- `merkle_root` (string, optional): Merkle root hash
- `nonce` (number, optional): Block nonce
- `node_pubkey` (string, required): Bitcoin node service pubkey (from event pubkey)

**Tags:**
- `["t", "<block_height>"]` (required): Block height as topic tag for filtering

**Example:**
```json
{
  "kind": 38088,
  "pubkey": "<node_service_pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1234567890,
  "tags": [
    ["t", "862626"]
  ],
  "content": "{
    \"height\": 862626,
    \"hash\": \"00000000000000000001a7c...\",
    \"time\": 1234567890,
    \"difficulty\": \"97345261772782.69\",
    \"tx_count\": 2345,
    \"node_pubkey\": \"<node_service_pubkey>\"
  }"
}
```

**Notes:**
- One event per block height per Bitcoin node service
- Multiple Bitcoin node services can publish for the same block (clients verify consensus)
- Published by services running Bitcoin nodes (like NextBlock's Observatory service)
- Block height in `t` tag enables efficient filtering: `{ kinds: [38088], "#t": ["862626"] }`
- All ATTN Protocol events reference block height via `["t", "<block_height>"]` tag
- Block events are the timing primitive for the entire protocol

### NIP-51 Lists (kind 30000)

The ATTN Protocol uses NIP-51 lists for user preferences around blocking and trusting actors and events. All ATTN Protocol lists use the namespace prefix `org.attnprotocol:` in their `d` tags.

**Naming Convention:** `org.attnprotocol:<resource>:<action>`

**List Types:**
- `["d", "org.attnprotocol:promotion:blocked"]` - Blocked promotions list (uses `a` tags)
- `["d", "org.attnprotocol:promoter:blocked"]` - Blocked promoters list (uses `p` tags)
- `["d", "org.attnprotocol:billboard:trusted"]` - Trusted billboards list (uses `a` tags)
- `["d", "org.attnprotocol:marketplace:trusted"]` - Trusted marketplaces list (uses `a` tags)

**Tag Usage:**
- **P tags**: Used to reference pubkeys (actors) - blocks/trusts ALL content from that pubkey
- **A tags**: Used to reference specific event coordinates - blocks/trusts specific instances

#### Blocked Promotions List
